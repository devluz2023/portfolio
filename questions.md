Exercises
In this chapter we have covered some of the most important concepts in Machine
Learning. In the next chapters we will dive deeper and write more code, but before we
do, make sure you know how to answer the following questions:

1. How would you define Machine Learning?
2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
3. What is a labeled training set?
4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to
   walk in various unknown terrains?
7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple
   groups?
8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning prob‐
   lem or an unsupervised learning problem?
9. What is an online learning system?
10. What is out-of-core learning?
11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predic‐
    tions?
12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm’s
    hyperparameter?
13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common
    strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?
14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?
15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new
    instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?
